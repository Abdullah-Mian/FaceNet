# Simple FaceID System - Documentation

## Getting Started

### Installation
Before using the face recognition system, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install torch torchvision
pip install facenet-pytorch
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy pillow
```

### How to Run
To execute the face recognition system:

# Navigate to your project directory

# Run the program
python InceptionResnetV1.py
```

### Storage Structure
The system stores data in the following locations:

- **Face Images**: Saved in the `faces/[person_name]/` directory
  - Each registered person gets their own folder
  - Multiple sample images are stored for each person

- **Embeddings**: Saved in `models/face_embeddings.pkl`
  - This pickle file contains a dictionary mapping names to face embeddings
  - Format: `{name: embedding_vector}`
  - The embeddings are 512-dimensional vectors that uniquely identify each face
  - These embeddings are used for authentication

When you register a new face, both the face images and the updated embeddings file are saved automatically. This allows the system to remember registered users between sessions.

## Overview

Face ID System Functionality
This markdown file explains how the Face ID system in your code works. It uses FaceNet, a face recognition framework developed by Google, to create numerical representations of faces and perform user registration and authentication.

FaceNet: Creating Face Embeddings

What is FaceNet?FaceNet is a framework that generates a numerical representation, called an embedding, for each face. These embeddings are 512-dimensional vectors in a high-dimensional space.

How are embeddings designed?The embeddings ensure that:

Faces of the same person are close together in this 512D space.
Faces of different people are far apart.


Training Method: Triplet LossFaceNet uses a special training method called triplet loss. This trains a neural network to generate embeddings by:

Comparing three images at a time: two of the same person (to minimize distance) and one of a different person (to maximize distance).
Optimizing the network to cluster similar faces and separate dissimilar ones.




The Model and Dataset

InceptionResnetV1: The FaceNet ModelThe code uses InceptionResnetV1, a neural network that implements the FaceNet framework. This model processes face images to produce the 512D embeddings.

VGGFace2: The Training DatasetInceptionResnetV1 is trained on the VGGFace2 dataset, developed by the University of Oxford. This dataset includes:

Over 3.3 million face images.
Faces from 9,131 unique individuals.This large and diverse dataset enables the model to create unique embeddings for each person.




How the System Works
The Face ID system has two main functions: registering new users and authenticating users. Here's how each process works.
Registering New Users

Steps:

The system captures multiple face images of a new user using a webcam.
Each image is processed by the InceptionResnetV1 model to generate a 512D embedding.
These embeddings are averaged to create a single, robust embedding for the user.
The averaged embedding is stored with the user's name.


Purpose:Averaging multiple embeddings ensures the stored representation is reliable and accounts for variations like lighting or pose.


Authenticating Users

Steps:

The system captures a single face image from the webcam.
The InceptionResnetV1 model generates a 512D embedding from this image.
This embedding is compared to all stored embeddings by calculating similarity (e.g., using the dot product).
If the similarity with a stored embedding exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.6), the user is authenticated as that person; otherwise, access is denied.


Purpose:The system verifies identity by checking how close the new embedding is to a known user's embedding in the 512D space.



Summary

FaceNet, developed by Google, creates 512D embeddings where similar faces cluster together and different faces are separated, using triplet loss for training.
InceptionResnetV1, trained on the VGGFace2 dataset (3.3M+ images, 9,131 people), generates these unique embeddings.
Registration: Stores an averaged embedding from multiple face images.
Authentication: Compares a new embedding to stored ones for identity verification.

This system provides a secure and efficient way to recognize and authenticate users based on their facial features.
